DETAILED TREATMENT HISTORY SUMMARY

Case: In re Johnson
Date: July 5, 2024
Compiled by: Dr. Elizabeth Warner, MD

PURPOSE:
This document provides a detailed chronological summary of Robert Johnson's psychiatric treatment history over the past 15 years, documenting the progression of his illness and multiple failed treatment trials. This history supports the conclusion that Mr. Johnson has treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

TREATMENT CHRONOLOGY:

2009 (Age 27): INITIAL PRESENTATION
- First psychiatric hospitalization following acute psychotic episode
- Presented to emergency room brought by family members due to bizarre behavior, paranoid statements, and auditory hallucinations
- Diagnosed with Schizophrenia, Paranoid Type
- Hospital course: 28 days inpatient treatment at State Psychiatric Hospital
- Initial medication: Risperidone 2mg BID, titrated to 3mg BID
- Discharge status: Significant improvement in positive symptoms, some residual paranoia
- Aftercare plan: Outpatient follow-up with community mental health center, continue risperidone

2009-2011: OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PERIOD
- Maintained on risperidone 4-6mg daily with reasonable stability for approximately 18 months
- Regular outpatient appointments at community mental health center
- Case manager noted gradual decline in medication adherence
- By late 2010, missing appointments and not filling prescriptions regularly
- Symptoms gradually returned - increased paranoia, social withdrawal, hygiene decline

2011 (Age 29): SECOND HOSPITALIZATION
- Readmitted following deterioration while off medication for several months
- 45-day hospitalization
- Risperidone restarted but with limited benefit (possible tolerance or disease progression)
- Switched to olanzapine 15mg QHS, titrated to 30mg QHS
- Good response to olanzapine - hallucinations diminished, less paranoid
- Discharge to group home setting with medication monitoring

2011-2013: GROUP HOME PERIOD
- Resided in supervised group home with daily medication administration
- Olanzapine continued at 30mg QHS
- Initially did well - participated in day program, some social interaction
- Significant weight gain (45 lbs in 18 months) and metabolic syndrome developed
- Blood glucose elevated (pre-diabetic range), cholesterol elevated
- Over time, symptoms began to re-emerge despite medication compliance

2013 (Age 31): MEDICATION SWITCH
- Olanzapine discontinued due to metabolic side effects and re-emerging symptoms
- Switched to quetiapine (Seroquel), titrated to 800mg daily over 3 months
- Minimal improvement in psychotic symptoms
- Continued to hear voices, paranoid ideation persisted
- Returned to live with mother as group home placement ended

2014 (Age 32): THIRD HOSPITALIZATION
- Emergency hospitalization following aggressive incident at day program (threatened staff member)
- 60-day hospitalization
- Quetiapine continued initially, then switched to aripiprazole (Abilify) 15mg daily
- Aripiprazole titrated to 30mg daily over 4 weeks
- Modest improvement but persistent hallucinations and paranoia
- Discharge back to mother's home with community treatment team support

2014-2015: COMMUNITY TREATMENT TEAM
- Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) team provided intensive outpatient services
- Home visits 3x weekly for medication administration and symptom monitoring
- Aripiprazole continued for 10 months with no significant improvement
- ACT team noted: "Client remains highly symptomatic despite medication compliance. Continues to report constant auditory hallucinations and believes neighbors are monitoring him. Difficult to engage in any psychosocial rehabilitation due to severity of symptoms."
- Medication adherence confirmed through observed administration and blood level monitoring

2015-2017: MULTIPLE HOSPITALIZATIONS
During this period, Mr. Johnson had four brief psychiatric hospitalizations (each 2-3 weeks):
- April 2015: Hospitalized for increasing paranoia and food refusal (believed food poisoned)
- November 2015: Hospitalized following suicide gesture (medication overdose - later clarified that he believed pills were vitamins and was trying to "strengthen himself against enemies")
- June 2016: Hospitalized for aggressive behavior toward family member
- January 2017: Hospitalized following found wandering neighborhood at night searching for "surveillance devices"

During this period, multiple medication adjustments were attempted:
- Return to risperidone (ineffective)
- Combination therapy: antipsychotic + mood stabilizer (no benefit)
- Long-acting injectable risperidone (symptoms persisted despite confirmed medication delivery)

2017-2019: RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITY
- Transferred to long-term residential psychiatric facility
- Extended trial of haloperidol (typical antipsychotic) - discontinued due to severe extrapyramidal side effects and no symptom improvement
- Return to olanzapine despite metabolic concerns - again provided some initial benefit but symptoms returned after 6 months
- Psychiatric consultation recommended clozapine trial, but Mr. Johnson refused consent for blood monitoring at that time

2019-2021: DECLINING FUNCTION
- Returned to mother's home as residential facility closed
- Medication non-adherence increased as symptoms worsened
- Multiple emergency room visits for evaluation
- Police called several times by neighbors due to Mr. Johnson's paranoid accusations and confrontational behavior
- Mother attempted to maintain outpatient appointments but Mr. Johnson increasingly refused to attend

2022-PRESENT: SEVERE DETERIORATION
- Essentially homebound, barricaded in bedroom
- Refuses all medications, believing they are "poison"
- Severe malnutrition, hygiene neglect
- Command hallucinations to harm others increasing
- May 2024: Assault on stranger (incident leading to current civil commitment petition)
- Current evaluation demonstrates continued severe psychosis with no remission

MEDICATIONS TRIED:
1. Risperidone (first-generation trial): Doses 2-6mg daily, duration: initially 18 months with benefit, subsequent trials ineffective
2. Olanzapine: Doses 15-30mg daily, duration: multiple trials totaling 3+ years, initial benefit but symptoms returned and metabolic side effects
3. Quetiapine: Doses up to 800mg daily, duration: 14 months, minimal benefit
4. Aripiprazole: Doses 15-30mg daily, duration: 10 months, no significant benefit
5. Haloperidol: (typical antipsychotic) Brief trial, discontinued due to side effects

All trials conducted with confirmed medication adherence (either observed administration in facility settings or blood level monitoring). Treatment failure not due to non-compliance but to actual medication inefficacy.

CLOZAPINE - THE NEXT STEP:
Clozapine is the only antipsychotic with proven superiority for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. It is considered the gold standard for patients who have failed 2+ adequate trials of other antipsychotics. Mr. Johnson clearly meets criteria for treatment-resistant schizophrenia with failed trials of four different medications.

Clozapine was recommended in 2017 but Mr. Johnson refused due to blood monitoring requirements. Given current civil commitment recommendation, clozapine trial could be initiated without his consent if court orders involuntary treatment.

Clozapine risks include: agranulocytosis (requires weekly blood monitoring), seizures, myocarditis, metabolic effects. However, for treatment-resistant cases, benefits often outweigh risks.

CONCLUSION:
Mr. Johnson's 15-year treatment history demonstrates:
1. Chronic, severe schizophrenia that has not responded to standard treatments
2. Multiple hospitalizations despite various medication trials
3. Confirmed medication adherence during supervised periods, ruling out non-compliance as primary factor
4. Progressive deterioration in functioning over time
5. Clear indication for clozapine trial as recommended treatment for treatment-resistant schizophrenia

This treatment history supports both the diagnosis of treatment-resistant schizophrenia and the need for intensive involuntary treatment intervention, including a trial of clozapine under medical supervision.
