COMPETENCY RESTORATION FOLLOW-UP MEMORANDUM

Case: State v. Williams
Date: July 15, 2024
Evaluator: Dr. Sandra Mitchell, PsyD

TO: Superior Court of Madison County
RE: 60-Day Competency Restoration Progress Assessment

BACKGROUND:
Despite my opinion that Mr. Tyrell Williams has poor prognosis for competency restoration due to intellectual disability, the court ordered a 90-day period of competency restoration services. This memorandum addresses his progress (or lack thereof) at the 60-day mark.

RESTORATION SERVICES PROVIDED:
Mr. Williams has attended 24 sessions of competency restoration programming at the state hospital forensic unit. Services have included:
- Group education on court procedures and roles of court personnel (3x weekly)
- Individual sessions reviewing legal concepts and case-specific information (2x weekly)
- Use of visual aids, simplified language, and repetitive teaching methods
- Mock court exercises to practice courtroom behavior
- Trauma-focused therapy for PTSD symptoms (1x weekly)

Treatment staff report that Mr. Williams has been cooperative and engaged in services. He attends sessions willingly and attempts to participate. His behavior has not been problematic.

CURRENT COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT:

After 60 days of intensive restoration services, re-evaluation reveals the following:

Factual Knowledge (Rote Learning):
Mr. Williams can now recite some basic facts about court when prompted:
- "The judge decides things"
- "The lawyer helps me"
- "Jury are people who listen"

However, this represents rote memorization rather than genuine understanding. When asked follow-up questions that require application of knowledge, he cannot respond. For example, he can state that "jury are people who listen," but when asked "How many people are on a jury?" or "What does the jury decide?", he cannot answer.

Rational Understanding (Abstract Concepts):
Mr. Williams continues to show no capacity for understanding abstract legal concepts:
- Cannot explain burden of proof despite multiple teaching sessions
- Does not understand presumption of innocence
- Cannot distinguish between different types of pleas beyond "guilty means you did it"
- Shows no understanding of evidentiary concepts or trial strategy

When asked to apply legal concepts to hypothetical scenarios, he becomes confused and gives contradictory responses. His intellectual limitations prevent the cognitive flexibility and abstract reasoning required for competent legal decision-making.

Ability to Assist Counsel:
His defense attorney reports no meaningful improvement in Mr. Williams' ability to assist with his defense. He cannot:
- Recall or describe events with sufficient detail
- Understand legal strategy options his attorney attempts to explain
- Make informed decisions about plea offers
- Understand the concept of testifying versus remaining silent

The attorney notes, "He's a kind young man who wants to help, but he simply cannot grasp what I need him to understand. I can't ethically advise him about plea decisions when he doesn't comprehend what he's agreeing to."

PTSD Symptoms:
There has been modest improvement in PTSD symptoms with trauma-focused therapy. Mr. Williams reports fewer intrusive thoughts and improved sleep. However, as noted in the initial evaluation, PTSD is not the primary barrier to competency - his intellectual disability is.

PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING:
Repeat WAIS-IV administration:
- Full Scale IQ: 67 (minimal change from initial 65, within measurement error)
- Subtest scores remain consistently in the intellectually disabled range

CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS:
Mr. Williams appears to have reached a plateau in competency restoration services. Despite continued programming, he has made no progress in the past 3 weeks. Treatment staff indicate that he has learned the maximum amount of rote information his cognitive capacity allows, but cannot move beyond superficial knowledge to genuine legal understanding.

Teaching staff note that Mr. Williams performs best with concrete, routine information but struggles immediately when any abstract thinking or novel application is required. This is entirely consistent with his intellectual functioning level and is not amenable to further educational intervention.

OPINIONS:

It remains my professional opinion that Mr. Williams is NOT competent to stand trial and that further restoration efforts are futile. The 60 days of intensive services have confirmed the initial poor prognosis. While he has memorized some factual information, he lacks the cognitive capacity for the rational understanding and abstract reasoning required for competency.

ETHICAL AND LEGAL CONCERNS:

Continuing to hold Mr. Williams in custody for competency restoration services that cannot succeed raises serious Jackson v. Indiana concerns. He is being detained not for punishment of a crime (as he has not been convicted), but because of an intellectual disability that is permanent and unchangeable.

If the state cannot bring him to trial because he is unrestorable to competency, continued detention amounts to indefinite civil commitment without the procedural protections required for such commitment. This is constitutionally problematic.

Additionally, attempting to "restore" competency in an individual with intellectual disability raises ethical concerns about informed consent and human dignity. Mr. Williams is being subjected to repeated educational interventions that he experiences as confusing and frustrating, with no realistic possibility of success.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Restoration services should be terminated as unsuccessful
2. Mr. Williams should be found permanently incompetent to stand trial
3. The court should consider:
   a. Dismissing charges
   b. Civil commitment for intellectual disability services if he poses danger (though there is no evidence of this)
   c. Guardianship proceedings and community placement with appropriate supports
4. Mr. Williams should not be held in custody indefinitely for unrestorable incompetency

The continuation of criminal proceedings against an individual who cannot ever become competent to participate in those proceedings serves no legitimate purpose and raises fundamental questions of fairness and constitutional due process.
