RELEVANT HISTORY:

Developmental and Family History:
Marcus is the younger of two children born to Denise Thompson (age 42) and Raymond Thompson (age 45, deceased 2019). His early developmental milestones were reportedly normal. Marcus's childhood was marked by significant adversity, including exposure to domestic violence between his parents, his father's chronic alcohol use disorder, and periods of housing instability. Child Protective Services were involved with the family on three occasions (2012, 2014, 2016) for neglect concerns, though Marcus was never removed from his mother's care.

Marcus's father died by suicide when Marcus was 12 years old, an event that appears to have been a significant turning point. Ms. Thompson reports that Marcus became increasingly withdrawn, angry, and defiant following this loss. The family received brief grief counseling through a community agency, but Marcus refused to continue after four sessions.

Educational History:
Marcus attended Seattle Public Schools through 10th grade. School records indicate early academic difficulties with special education evaluation in 4th grade identifying reading comprehension deficits. Despite an IQ in the average range (WISC-IV Full Scale IQ: 96), Marcus struggled academically due to behavioral problems and inconsistent attendance. He received multiple suspensions for fighting (grades 6-10) and was expelled from high school in January 2024 for bringing a knife to school.

Substance Use History:
Marcus reports first using marijuana at age 13, initially on weekends with older peers. By age 15, he was using marijuana daily. He denies use of other substances except for experimental alcohol use. Urine drug screens during his current detention have been negative.

Mental Health Treatment History:
Marcus was first seen by a mental health provider at age 13 following his father's death. He attended four sessions of grief counseling before discontinuing. At age 14, following an assault on a peer at school, he was evaluated at Harborview Medical Center where he was diagnosed with Conduct Disorder and ADHD. He was prescribed methylphenidate but discontinued after three weeks, reporting it made him feel "weird." 

Between ages 15-16, Marcus participated in outpatient treatment at Youth Eastside Services where he was seen for individual therapy approximately monthly. Attendance was inconsistent. Records indicate he was diagnosed with Conduct Disorder and Cannabis Use Disorder. Treatment focused on anger management and substance abuse, but Marcus was discharged after six months due to poor engagement.

Juvenile Justice History:
Marcus's first contact with juvenile justice was at age 14 (2021) for Theft in the Third Degree. He received a diversion agreement which he completed successfully. At age 15 (2022), he was adjudicated for Assault in the Fourth Degree following a fight at school and received community supervision and 40 hours of community service. At age 16 (2023), he was adjudicated for Robbery in the Second Degree and Possession of Marijuana. He was placed on 12 months of community supervision with conditions including substance abuse treatment, individual counseling, and a 7pm curfew. Records indicate inconsistent compliance with supervision requirements.

Current Offense:
According to police reports and witness statements, on June 3, 2024, Marcus and two associates approached two teenage males (ages 16 and 17) in the parking lot of a convenience store in the Rainier Valley neighborhood. An altercation occurred, allegedly over a prior dispute. Marcus reportedly displayed a handgun and fired two shots, striking one victim in the shoulder and the other in the leg. Both victims survived with non-life-threatening injuries. Marcus was apprehended approximately two hours later. A .38 caliber handgun was recovered from a nearby location based on information provided by witnesses.

CURRENT MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:

Marcus presented as a tall, lean African American adolescent male who appeared his stated age. He was dressed in standard juvenile detention clothing and maintained adequate hygiene. He was cooperative with the evaluation process, maintaining appropriate eye contact and responding to questions, though at times his responses were guarded or minimizing.

Speech was normal in rate, tone, and volume. Thought processes were logical and goal-directed without evidence of looseness of associations or tangentiality. There was no evidence of hallucinations, delusions, or other psychotic symptoms. Marcus denied current suicidal or homicidal ideation and denied such thoughts at the time of the alleged offense.

Mood was described as "alright" and affect was somewhat restricted but appropriate to content. He expressed some remorse regarding the victims' injuries but tended to externalize responsibility, stating "things got out of hand" and "I wasn't trying to hit nobody." 

Cognitively, Marcus was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. Attention and concentration were adequate. Recent and remote memory appeared intact. Intellectual functioning was estimated to be in the average range, consistent with formal testing (WAIS-IV Full Scale IQ: 94). Insight into his current legal situation was fair; he understood the charges and possible consequences. Judgment was impaired, particularly regarding impulse control and consideration of consequences.

PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING:

WAIS-IV (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition):
Full Scale IQ: 94 (Average range, 34th percentile)
Verbal Comprehension Index: 91
Perceptual Reasoning Index: 98  
Working Memory Index: 88
Processing Speed Index: 96

Testing revealed cognitive functioning in the average range with no significant pattern of strengths or weaknesses. Working memory was the relative weakness, though still in the low average range.

MMPI-A (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory - Adolescent):
The validity scales suggested a defensive response style with some minimization of psychological difficulties. Elevated clinical scales included Scale 4 (Psychopathic Deviate, T=72) and Scale 9 (Hypomania, T=68), suggesting impulsivity, disregard for social norms, and risk-taking behavior. Scale 2 (Depression) was moderately elevated (T=63), suggesting underlying mood difficulties.

DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS:

Based on clinical interview, collateral information, records review, and psychological testing, Marcus meets criteria for the following diagnoses per DSM-5-TR:

1. Conduct Disorder, Childhood-Onset Type, Severe, With Limited Prosocial Emotions (312.81)
   - Pattern of aggression toward people and animals
   - Destruction of property
   - Serious violations of rules
   - Onset prior to age 10 (per maternal report and school records)
   - Presence of callous-unemotional traits including lack of remorse, shallow affect

2. Cannabis Use Disorder, Moderate, In a Controlled Environment (305.20)
   - Pattern of problematic use from ages 13-17
   - Currently in detention facility preventing use

3. Rule out: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (exposure to domestic violence, father's suicide)

RISK ASSESSMENT:

The Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY) was administered to evaluate risk for future violence. This evidence-based tool examines historical, social/contextual, and individual/clinical risk factors as well as protective factors.

Risk Factors Present (High Priority):
- History of violence
- History of non-violent offending  
- Early initiation of violence
- Past supervision/intervention failures
- History of self-harm or suicide attempts (father's suicide; Marcus with suicidal ideation age 14)
- Exposure to violence in the home
- Parental/caregiver criminality (father's extensive criminal history)
- Poor school achievement
- Peer delinquency
- Substance use difficulties
- Anger management problems
- Low empathy/remorse
- Impulsivity
- Negative attitudes

Protective Factors Present:
- Prosocial involvement (some, through church attendance with mother)
- Strong social support (mother, aunt, some extended family)
- Strong attachments and bonds (to mother and younger cousin)
- Positive attitude toward intervention/authority (variable, but some present)
- Resilient personality traits (average intelligence, some capacity for reflection)

Overall Risk Rating: MODERATE to HIGH risk for future violence

The presence of multiple historical risk factors, particularly early onset of conduct problems and escalating violence, combined with limited prosocial emotions, places Marcus at elevated risk. However, the presence of protective factors, particularly family support and average intellectual functioning, provides some basis for intervention.

OPINIONS REGARDING TRANSFER:

The court has requested an opinion regarding whether Marcus should be transferred to adult court for prosecution. Washington State law requires consideration of several factors outlined in RCW 13.40.110, which I address below:

1. Age of the child and the nature of the alleged offense:
Marcus is 17 years old, approaching the upper age limit of juvenile jurisdiction. The alleged offenses (Aggravated Assault with a firearm) are serious and resulted in significant harm to two victims. However, no deaths occurred, and there is no evidence of premeditation or planning. The incident appears to have escalated from a confrontation related to ongoing peer conflict.

2. The extent and nature of prior adjudications:
Marcus has three prior juvenile adjudications over a four-year period, showing a pattern of escalating violence from theft to assault to robbery and now alleged aggravated assault with a weapon. This pattern is concerning and demonstrates that previous interventions have been insufficient. However, it should be noted that Marcus never received intensive residential treatment or comprehensive evidence-based interventions.

3. Previous history of violent acts:
Marcus has engaged in physical fights since middle school, with documented assaults at ages 15 and 16. The current alleged offense represents a significant escalation involving use of a firearm. However, his prior violent acts did not result in serious injury and occurred in the context of peer conflicts rather than predatory violence.

4. Character and mental maturity:
Psychological evaluation reveals that Marcus demonstrates emotional and cognitive immaturity consistent with adolescent development. Neuropsychological research demonstrates that the adolescent brain, particularly the prefrontal cortex responsible for impulse control and consideration of consequences, continues developing into the mid-20s. Marcus shows significant deficits in judgment, impulse control, and future orientation. His conduct disorder diagnosis with callous-unemotional traits indicates significant characterological problems, but the developmental context is important.

Testing and clinical interview reveal that Marcus is capable of understanding consequences but has impaired capacity to integrate this knowledge into behavioral decision-making, particularly in emotionally charged situations. This is consistent with adolescent brain development rather than fixed characterological pathology.

5. Likelihood of rehabilitation:
This is perhaps the most critical factor. Marcus's history shows partial response to interventions, but he has never received intensive, evidence-based treatment. His prior treatments were brief, unfocused, and poorly engaged. Research demonstrates that adolescents with conduct disorder can show significant improvement with intensive interventions including multisystemic therapy (MST), functional family therapy (FFT), or residential treatment programs incorporating cognitive-behavioral therapy and skills training.

Several factors support potential for rehabilitation:
- Average intelligence provides capacity for learning and skill development
- Presence of family support and prosocial connections  
- Some capacity for remorse and self-reflection observed in evaluation
- Prior successful completion of diversion program demonstrates some capacity for compliance
- Adolescent brain plasticity suggests potential for behavioral change

Factors that complicate rehabilitation:
- Severity of conduct disorder symptoms including limited prosocial emotions
- History of treatment non-compliance
- Negative peer associations
- Ongoing neighborhood risk factors

6. Protection of the community:
Community safety is paramount. However, research consistently demonstrates that transfer to adult court does not enhance public safety and may increase recidivism risk. Adolescents placed in adult facilities have higher rates of re-offense compared to those remaining in juvenile systems. The juvenile justice system offers more intensive supervision, treatment, and educational services during the remaining years of jurisdiction.

Marcus would remain under juvenile jurisdiction until age 21 if not transferred, providing approximately 3.5 years for intensive intervention. Evidence-based programs in the juvenile system have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing recidivism among high-risk youth.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

It is my opinion that Marcus Thompson demonstrates moderate amenability to rehabilitation within the juvenile justice system with appropriate intensive interventions. While his conduct disorder diagnosis and history of escalating violence are serious concerns, several factors support retention in juvenile court:

1. Developmental immaturity and ongoing brain development support capacity for change
2. Presence of protective factors including family support and average intelligence  
3. Never received intensive, evidence-based interventions for conduct disorder
4. Research demonstrates poorer outcomes for juveniles transferred to adult system
5. Juvenile system provides access to developmentally appropriate education and treatment

I recommend the following if Marcus remains in juvenile jurisdiction:

1. Placement in secure residential treatment facility specializing in adolescents with conduct disorder and providing evidence-based interventions (e.g., aggression replacement training, cognitive-behavioral therapy, skills training)

2. Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation for medication management (mood stabilization may be indicated)

3. Substance abuse treatment with ongoing monitoring

4. Family therapy to strengthen protective relationships and address family system issues

5. Educational services addressing learning difficulties and working toward high school equivalency

6. Graduated transition planning with intensive aftercare supervision including GPS monitoring, frequent drug testing, and continued treatment

7. Trauma-focused therapy to address exposure to father's suicide and childhood domestic violence

8. Vocational training and pro-social skill development

Transfer to adult court would likely result in incarceration in adult facilities where Marcus would have limited access to education, treatment, or rehabilitative programming. Research demonstrates this increases rather than decreases recidivism risk. While the current alleged offense is serious, Marcus's age, developmental status, and potential for rehabilitation support retention in the juvenile system with intensive intervention.

LIMITATIONS:

This evaluation is based on information available at the time of assessment. Marcus was motivated to present himself in a favorable light, which may have influenced his self-report. The opinions expressed are rendered to a reasonable degree of medical certainty but are not absolute predictions of future behavior. Risk assessment instruments provide probabilistic estimates, not certainties.
