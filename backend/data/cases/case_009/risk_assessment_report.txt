RISK ASSESSMENT REPORT
Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY)

SUBJECT: Marcus Allen Thompson
DOB: March 12, 2007 (Age 17)
CASE NUMBER: JUV-2024-00847
DATE OF ASSESSMENT: August 12, 2024
EVALUATOR: Patricia Chen, MD

PURPOSE OF ASSESSMENT:

This risk assessment was conducted to evaluate Marcus Thompson's risk for future violence to inform the juvenile court's decision regarding potential transfer to adult court. The assessment utilizes the Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY), an evidence-based tool designed to assess violence risk in adolescents ages 12-18.

METHODOLOGY:

The SAVRY is a structured professional judgment tool that examines 24 risk factors across three domains (Historical, Social/Contextual, and Individual/Clinical) and six protective factors. Each risk factor is rated as Low, Moderate, or High based on available information. Protective factors are also rated. The tool does not generate a numerical score but guides clinical judgment regarding overall risk level.

Information sources:
- Clinical interviews with Marcus Thompson
- Collateral interviews with mother and aunt
- Review of juvenile justice records
- Educational records
- Mental health treatment records
- Police reports and witness statements
- Psychological testing results

HISTORICAL RISK FACTORS (10 items):

H1. History of Violence: HIGH
Marcus has an established pattern of violent behavior dating to early adolescence. Prior adjudications include Assault 4 (age 15) and Robbery 2 (age 16). Multiple school suspensions for fighting. Current charges involve aggravated assault with a firearm resulting in serious injury to two victims. Pattern shows escalation in severity and use of weapons.

H2. History of Non-Violent Offending: HIGH  
Multiple non-violent offenses including Theft 3 (age 14), expulsion from school for weapons possession, chronic truancy, and curfew violations. Pattern of rule violations and antisocial behavior.

H3. Early Initiation of Violence: HIGH
According to school records and maternal report, Marcus engaged in physical aggression toward peers beginning in elementary school (age 7-8). First formal violence charge at age 15, but pattern established much earlier.

H4. Past Supervision/Intervention Failures: HIGH
Marcus has demonstrated poor compliance with previous interventions. Failed to complete conditions of juvenile supervision for robbery charge including inconsistent attendance at counseling and substance abuse treatment. Multiple curfew violations. Left aunt's home after three weeks during attempted alternative placement. Discontinued prescribed medication. Discharged from outpatient therapy for non-attendance.

H5. History of Self-Harm or Suicide Attempts: MODERATE
No documented suicide attempts. Endorsed passive suicidal ideation at age 14 ("sometimes I wish I wasn't here") following assault incident and ongoing grief related to father's suicide. Witnessed father's completed suicide at age 12, which is a significant risk factor for future suicidal behavior. Currently denies suicidal ideation.

H6. Exposure to Violence in the Home: HIGH
Extensive exposure to domestic violence between parents from early childhood through age 12. Witnessed multiple physical altercations. Police called to home on numerous occasions. CPS involvement due to domestic violence. Physical discipline from father that was harsh and potentially abusive. Witnessed father's death by suicide.

H7. Childhood History of Maltreatment: MODERATE
CPS investigations found evidence of neglect and exposure to domestic violence. Physical discipline from father was harsh though investigations were inconclusive regarding abuse. Emotional neglect during father's incarcerations and due to mother's work schedule and depression. No documented sexual abuse.

H8. Parental/Caregiver Criminality: HIGH
Father had extensive criminal history including multiple DUI arrests, assault charges, and felony conviction for Possession of Stolen Property. Two periods of incarceration during Marcus's childhood. Father's antisocial behavior and substance abuse directly impacted family functioning and Marcus's development.

H9. Early Caregiver Disruption: MODERATE
Father's incarcerations resulted in periods of absence during Marcus's childhood (ages 4-5 and 8-9). Father's death when Marcus was 12 represented significant loss and disruption. Inconsistent parenting due to mother's work schedule and both parents' relationship instability. However, Marcus remained with his mother continuously and was never in foster care.

H10. Poor School Achievement: HIGH
Chronic academic underachievement despite average intelligence. Reading 2+ years below grade level. Failing most classes by high school. Accumulated insufficient credits for grade promotion. Expelled from traditional high school. Chronic truancy. 504 plan accommodations ineffective due to behavioral problems and non-attendance.

SOCIAL/CONTEXTUAL RISK FACTORS (6 items):

S1. Peer Delinquency: HIGH
Primary peer associations are with delinquent and gang-affiliated individuals. Several close associates have juvenile records for violence and weapons offenses. Current alleged offense occurred in context of peer group activity. Marcus derives identity and sense of belonging primarily from delinquent peer group.

S2. Peer Rejection: LOW
Marcus is not socially isolated or rejected by peers. He has established friendships, though primarily with antisocial peers. Some capacity for social connection.

S3. Stress and Poor Coping: HIGH
Multiple stressors including poverty, neighborhood violence, father's suicide, family conflict, school failure, and legal problems. Limited positive coping strategies. Relies on marijuana use and antisocial peer group for coping. Poor emotional regulation. Difficulty managing anger and frustration.

S4. Poor Parental Management: HIGH
Mother acknowledges difficulty managing Marcus's behavior, particularly since early adolescence. Inconsistent limit-setting. Limited monitoring capability due to work schedule. Father's parenting was harsh and inconsistent. Lack of structure and supervision, particularly evenings. Strained parent-child relationship with frequent conflict.

S5. Lack of Personal/Social Support: MODERATE
While Marcus has some social support from mother, aunt, and extended family, these relationships are strained. Limited prosocial adult mentors or positive peer relationships. Some support exists but is insufficient given level of need.

S6. Community Disorganization: HIGH
Resides in high-crime neighborhood with significant gang activity and drug trafficking. Limited recreational and prosocial opportunities. Exposure to community violence. Neighborhood context reinforces antisocial values and provides opportunities for criminal activity.

INDIVIDUAL/CLINICAL RISK FACTORS (8 items):

I1. Negative Attitudes: HIGH
Demonstrates antisocial attitudes including minimization of consequences, externalization of blame, and some glorification of violence. Limited respect for authority. However, not completely entrenched - shows some capacity for alternative thinking.

I2. Risk Taking/Impulsivity: HIGH
Pattern of impulsive, thrill-seeking behavior. Poor consideration of consequences. Engages in dangerous activities including carrying firearms, substance use, and physical confrontations. Working memory deficits may contribute to impulsivity. Consistent with adolescent brain development but more severe than typical.

I3. Substance Use Difficulties: MODERATE (Currently HIGH, rated MODERATE given controlled environment)
History of daily marijuana use from ages 13-17, meeting criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder, Moderate. Used substances to cope with negative emotions. Currently abstinent due to detention. Denies use of other substances, which is protective. Risk would be HIGH if released without treatment.

I4. Anger Management Problems: HIGH
Chronic difficulty managing anger. "Short fuse" per self-report and collateral sources. Multiple violent incidents triggered by perceived disrespect or conflict. Limited skills for anger management despite some prior interventions.

I5. Low Empathy/Remorse: HIGH
Demonstrates limited prosocial emotions consistent with conduct disorder diagnosis. Shows some remorse regarding victims' injuries but tends to minimize and externalize responsibility. Limited perspective-taking ability. Callous-unemotional traits present but not absolute - shows some capacity for emotional connection with family members.

I6. Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Difficulties: MODERATE
Diagnosed with ADHD at age 14. Displays inattention, difficulty with sustained focus, and impulsivity. However, discontinued medication and symptoms may be partially attributable to other factors (trauma, substance use, conduct problems). Working memory deficits noted on testing.

I7. Poor Compliance: HIGH
Consistent pattern of non-compliance with authority, rules, and interventions. Poor attendance at school, therapy, and substance abuse treatment. Violations of probation conditions. Discontinued prescribed medication. However, did complete diversion program successfully at age 14, indicating some capacity for compliance with appropriate structure.

I8. Low Interest/Commitment to School: HIGH
Chronic truancy and disengagement from education. Expelled from traditional high school. Failed to attend alternative school consistently. Describes school as "boring" and "pointless." However, testing indicates average intelligence and capacity to learn, suggesting disengagement rather than inability.

PROTECTIVE FACTORS (6 items):

P1. Prosocial Involvement: MODERATE
Limited but present. Attends church with mother periodically. Previously participated in basketball, though discontinued. Some connection to younger cousin whom he describes protectively. More prosocial involvement in childhood with decline in adolescence.

P2. Strong Social Support: MODERATE
Mother remains engaged and concerned despite relationship strain. Aunt and grandmother provide some support. Extended family connections exist. However, relationships are strained and support is inconsistent. Stronger than many high-risk youth but insufficient given needs.

P3. Strong Attachments and Bonds: MODERATE  
Demonstrates attachment to mother despite conflict. Close relationship with younger cousin. Shows some capacity for loyalty and emotional connection. However, strongest bonds are to delinquent peers rather than prosocial supports. Some foundation for building stronger positive attachments exists.

P4. Positive Attitude Toward Intervention and Authority: LOW
History of poor engagement with interventions and oppositional behavior toward authority. However, Marcus was cooperative with this evaluation and has shown some capacity for engagement when interventions are intensive and meaningful to him (completed diversion program). Not completely oppositional but generally resistant.

P5. Strong Commitment to School: LOW
Chronically disengaged from education. However, average intelligence suggests capacity that could be redirected with appropriate educational programming and support.

P6. Resilient Personality Traits: MODERATE
Average intelligence is protective factor. Some capacity for self-reflection demonstrated during evaluation. Demonstrates loyalty and protective feelings toward younger cousin. Has survived significant adversity. Some sense of humor and interpersonal skills. However, emotional regulation deficits and limited prosocial emotions are concerning.

SUMMARY RISK RATING:

Historical Risk Factors: 8 of 10 rated Moderate or High (80%)
Social/Contextual Risk Factors: 5 of 6 rated Moderate or High (83%)
Individual/Clinical Risk Factors: 8 of 8 rated Moderate or High (100%)

Protective Factors: 3 of 6 rated Moderate (50% present at moderate level)

OVERALL RISK JUDGMENT: MODERATE-HIGH RISK FOR FUTURE VIOLENCE

Marcus presents with numerous and significant risk factors for continued violence across all domains. The historical pattern of early-onset, escalating violence combined with callous-unemotional traits, substance use, delinquent peer associations, and multiple intervention failures places him at elevated risk. The current offense represents a significant escalation involving use of a firearm and serious injury to victims.

However, several factors moderate this risk assessment:

1. Presence of protective factors including family support, average intelligence, and some capacity for prosocial connection
2. Adolescent developmental stage with associated brain plasticity and capacity for change
3. Never received intensive, evidence-based interventions appropriate to risk level
4. Some demonstrated capacity for compliance when provided sufficient structure (successful diversion completion)
5. Current offense occurred in reactive context of peer conflict rather than predatory pattern

The distinction between MODERATE and HIGH risk is significant: Marcus shows characteristics of both levels. Without intensive intervention, risk is HIGH and likely to result in continued serious violence. With appropriate intensive treatment, supervision, and support, risk can likely be reduced to MODERATE level.

RISK MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:

To reduce risk of future violence, the following interventions are indicated:

SHORT-TERM (Immediate):
1. Secure residential placement providing structure and intensive supervision
2. Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation for medication management (mood stabilization, ADHD treatment)
3. Immediate enrollment in evidence-based violence reduction program (e.g., Aggression Replacement Training)
4. Substance abuse treatment with relapse prevention planning
5. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy
6. Family therapy to strengthen protective relationships

MEDIUM-TERM (6-18 months):
1. Graduated transition from secure placement with intensive aftercare
2. Continued individual therapy focusing on emotional regulation, perspective-taking, prosocial values
3. Educational programming addressing learning deficits and working toward high school equivalency
4. Vocational assessment and training
5. Structured prosocial activities (mentoring, athletics, community service)
6. GPS monitoring and intensive supervision upon community reintegration

LONG-TERM (18+ months):
1. Continued monitoring and support through age 21 (juvenile jurisdiction)
2. Connection to adult services for mental health and substance abuse treatment
3. Employment support and independent living skills
4. Continued family therapy and strengthening of prosocial support network
5. Periodic risk reassessment

CRITICAL FACTORS FOR RISK REDUCTION:

Marcus's risk level is significantly influenced by environmental and intervention factors. Key variables that will impact his trajectory:

1. INTENSITY AND QUALITY OF INTERVENTION: Half-measures have consistently failed. Only intensive, evidence-based, comprehensive treatment can address the multiple risk factors present.

2. PEER ASSOCIATIONS: Disconnection from delinquent peers and development of prosocial relationships is essential. This requires environmental change, not just individual counseling.

3. FAMILY ENGAGEMENT: Strengthening family relationships and improving parental capacity to provide structure and support is critical protective factor.

4. SUBSTANCE ABUSE: Continued sobriety is essential. Relapse to marijuana use will significantly increase violence risk.

5. DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORY: Adolescent brain maturation over next 5-8 years provides window of opportunity for intervention. This developmental period is critical.

COMPARISON OF JUVENILE VS. ADULT SYSTEM:

Violence Risk in Juvenile System:
With intensive interventions available in juvenile system, risk can likely be reduced from MODERATE-HIGH to MODERATE over 2-3 years. Juvenile facilities offer therapeutic environment, education, evidence-based programming, and graduated reintegration. Research indicates improved outcomes for high-risk youth treated in juvenile settings.

Violence Risk in Adult System:
Transfer to adult system would likely maintain or increase violence risk. Adult facilities offer minimal treatment, education, or supervision. Research consistently shows higher recidivism rates for juveniles transferred to adult system. Exposure to adult offenders, lack of developmental programming, and harsh conditions increase rather than decrease violence risk. Marcus would likely emerge from adult incarceration at higher risk than current level.

LIMITATIONS:

This assessment represents professional judgment based on available information. Risk assessment is probabilistic, not deterministic - it estimates likelihood but cannot predict with certainty. Marcus's actual trajectory will depend significantly on interventions provided, environmental factors, and his own choices. Risk level can change over time and should be reassessed periodically. The assessment assumes implementation of recommended interventions; without these, risk estimates would be higher.

CONCLUSION:

Marcus Thompson presents at MODERATE-HIGH risk for future violence. This elevated risk is driven by numerous concerning factors including early-onset conduct problems with limited prosocial emotions, escalating violence culminating in serious assault with a firearm, substance abuse, delinquent peer associations, and multiple prior intervention failures. However, the presence of protective factors, his developmental stage, and the absence of intensive prior interventions support potential for risk reduction within the juvenile justice system with appropriate services. Transfer to adult system would likely result in higher long-term violence risk due to loss of treatment opportunities and exposure to criminogenic environment.
