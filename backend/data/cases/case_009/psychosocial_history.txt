FAMILY BACKGROUND AND COMPOSITION:

Nuclear Family:
Marcus is the second child of Denise Thompson and Raymond Thompson. His older sister, Tamika Thompson, is 22 years old and currently lives independently. Parents were never married but maintained an on-and-off relationship until Raymond's death in 2019.

Mother - Denise Thompson (Age 42):
Ms. Thompson works as a certified nursing assistant at a long-term care facility, typically working evening shifts. She completed high school and one year of community college. She describes her health as "okay" though she has hypertension and diabetes, which she manages with medication. Ms. Thompson presents as caring and concerned about Marcus but appears somewhat overwhelmed by his behavioral problems. She has no criminal history. She reports a history of depression following Raymond's suicide, for which she took antidepressants briefly but discontinued due to side effects.

Father - Raymond Thompson (Deceased 2019, Age 38 at death):
According to Ms. Thompson and family members, Raymond struggled with alcohol use disorder throughout his adult life. He worked sporadically in construction and maintenance jobs but had extended periods of unemployment. He had an extensive criminal history including multiple DUI arrests, assault charges, and a felony conviction for Possession of Stolen Property. He served two periods of incarceration when Marcus was ages 4-5 and 8-9. Raymond died by suicide via hanging on May 17, 2019, when Marcus was 12 years old. Marcus found his father's body.

Sibling - Tamika Thompson (Age 22):
Tamika graduated high school and attended community college for two years, studying medical assisting. She currently works as a medical assistant and lives with her boyfriend. According to Ms. Thompson, Tamika maintained better school performance and had fewer behavioral problems than Marcus. She attributes this partly to Tamika being older and "getting out before things got really bad" with Raymond's drinking and violence. Tamika has minimal contact with Marcus currently, describing their relationship as "complicated."

Extended Family:
Maternal grandmother (Evelyn Williams, age 67) lives in Seattle and has provided periodic support to the family. She has health problems including COPD and uses oxygen. Maternal aunt (Sharon Williams, age 45) has been supportive and describes Marcus as "a good kid who got mixed up with the wrong crowd." She tried to have Marcus stay with her for a period when he was 15, but he left after three weeks. Paternal family members have minimal contact with Marcus and were not available for interview.

DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:

Prenatal and Birth:
According to Ms. Thompson, pregnancy with Marcus was "normal" though she experienced stress due to relationship problems with Raymond. She received prenatal care through the public health department. She denies use of alcohol or drugs during pregnancy. Marcus was born at term via normal vaginal delivery at Harborview Medical Center, birthweight 7 lbs 2 oz. No complications were reported.

Early Childhood (Birth to Age 5):
Developmental milestones were reportedly achieved within normal limits. Marcus walked at 13 months, spoke first words around 12 months, and was toilet trained by age 3. Ms. Thompson describes him as an "active" child who was "into everything" but not necessarily more difficult than other children. He attended daycare from age 2 when Ms. Thompson returned to work. Daycare providers noted he had difficulty with transitions and sharing but no major behavioral concerns.

Medical records from Seattle Children's Hospital indicate Marcus was treated for common childhood illnesses including ear infections and a broken arm at age 4 (fell from playground equipment). No chronic health conditions were identified.

Middle Childhood (Ages 6-11):
Marcus started kindergarten at age 5 at Rainier View Elementary School. Early school reports indicate he was "energetic" and had difficulty sitting still and following directions. He was referred for evaluation for possible ADHD in 2nd grade but Ms. Thompson declined medication at that time. Academic testing in 4th grade (age 9) showed reading comprehension below grade level. He was provided with additional reading support but was not placed in special education.

Ms. Thompson reports that during this period, domestic violence between her and Raymond escalated. Police were called to the home on multiple occasions. Marcus witnessed physical altercations and was present during at least two incidents where Raymond was arrested. Child Protective Services became involved in 2012 (Marcus age 5) and again in 2014 (age 7) following reports from school personnel who observed bruising on Marcus that he attributed to his father. CPS investigations found evidence of domestic violence but Marcus was not removed. Services offered included parenting classes for Ms. Thompson and domestic violence victim services, which she engaged with sporadically.

Marcus showed increasing behavioral problems at school during this period, including fighting with peers, defiance toward teachers, and truancy. He was suspended multiple times in 5th grade. At home, Ms. Thompson reports he became increasingly oppositional and had frequent arguments with his father that sometimes became physical.

Raymond was incarcerated from 2015-2016 (Marcus ages 8-9) for assault. Ms. Thompson reports this was actually a "calmer time" at home, though finances were difficult and Marcus expressed anger about his father being gone.

Adolescence (Ages 12-17):

Age 12-13 (2019-2020):
Raymond Thompson died by suicide in May 2019. Marcus found his father hanging in the basement of their apartment building. Police and medics responded. Marcus was transported to Harborview Medical Center for evaluation and was assessed by the crisis intervention team. He denied suicidal ideation at that time but expressed confusion and anger about his father's death.

Following this trauma, Marcus was referred to grief counseling through a community mental health agency. He attended four sessions before refusing to continue. His mother reports he became withdrawn, stayed in his room more, and began hanging out with older peers in the neighborhood. His grades dropped significantly and he was frequently truant from school.

Age 14-15 (2021-2022):
This period saw escalation of behavioral problems. Marcus was arrested for shoplifting at age 14 and entered a diversion agreement. Ms. Thompson reports he was coming home late or not at all, associating with gang-affiliated peers, and she suspected marijuana use though he denied it initially. He began failing most classes and was suspended multiple times for fighting.

After an assault on a peer at school, Marcus was evaluated at Harborview where he was diagnosed with Conduct Disorder and ADHD. Medication (methylphenidate) was prescribed but Marcus discontinued after three weeks. His first juvenile adjudication for Assault 4 occurred at age 15 following another school fight.

Age 16-17 (2023-2024):
Marcus was adjudicated for Robbery 2 at age 16 after he and peers took money and a phone from another teenager at a bus stop. He was placed on supervision with conditions including substance abuse treatment, counseling, and curfew. Compliance was poor. He was expelled from high school in January 2024 for bringing a knife to school (he stated it was for protection). He was enrolled in an alternative school but attended sporadically.

Ms. Thompson reports that during this period Marcus became increasingly difficult to manage. He was often out late, sometimes not returning home. She suspected gang involvement but Marcus denied formal membership, stating he was just "cool with" certain people. She found marijuana in his room on multiple occasions. Their relationship became more conflictual with frequent arguments.

The current alleged offense occurred on June 3, 2024, approximately five months after his expulsion from high school and while he was on juvenile supervision for the robbery conviction.

EDUCATIONAL HISTORY:

Schools Attended:
- Rainier View Elementary School (K-5): 2012-2018
- Aki Kurose Middle School (6-8): 2018-2020
- Franklin High School (9-10): 2020-2024 (expelled January 2024)
- South Lake Alternative High School: Spring 2024 (minimal attendance)

Academic Performance:
Early elementary school records indicate Marcus performed at grade level in kindergarten and 1st grade, though teachers noted difficulty with focus and following directions. Academic problems became more apparent in 3rd-4th grades, particularly with reading comprehension. Testing indicated he was reading 1-2 years below grade level. Math skills were closer to grade level.

By middle school, Marcus was failing most classes due to poor attendance, incomplete assignments, and behavioral problems. Standardized testing in 7th grade showed reading at 5th grade level. High school transcripts show mostly Fs and Ds with occasional Cs. He failed to earn sufficient credits for promotion to 11th grade.

Special Education/Testing:
Marcus was evaluated for special education services in 4th grade due to reading difficulties. Testing revealed:
- WISC-IV Full Scale IQ: 96 (Average range)
- Verbal Comprehension: 92
- Perceptual Reasoning: 101
- Working Memory: 89
- Processing Speed: 94

He was found eligible for 504 accommodations due to suspected ADHD and was provided with extended time for tests, preferential seating, and frequent breaks. However, these accommodations were inconsistently implemented and their effectiveness was limited by Marcus's truancy and behavioral issues.

Behavioral History at School:
Marcus accumulated numerous disciplinary referrals from elementary through high school:
- 15+ suspensions for fighting, defiance, disruptive behavior
- Multiple referrals for truancy
- Peer conflict and bullying complaints (both as perpetrator and victim)
- Gang-related concerns noted by school staff
- Expelled January 2024 for weapons violation

Teachers described Marcus as capable but unmotivated, disruptive, and disrespectful. Several noted that he could be charming and funny when in good moods but had "a temper" and reacted poorly to redirection. One teacher noted, "Marcus is smart enough to do the work, he just doesn't care."

SUBSTANCE USE HISTORY:

Marcus reports first experimenting with marijuana at age 13, shortly after his father's death. He states an older cousin introduced him to it at a family gathering. Initially, he used marijuana on weekends with peers. By age 14-15, use increased to daily use. He reports using marijuana to help him sleep, manage anger, and cope with negative feelings.

Marcus denies significant use of alcohol beyond occasional drinking at parties. He denies use of methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, or other substances. He denies ever using prescription medications not prescribed to him. His mother suspected marijuana use beginning around age 14 but Marcus initially denied it. She found marijuana in his room on several occasions.

During his participation in outpatient substance abuse counseling at ages 16-17, Marcus acknowledged daily marijuana use but minimized its impact on his life. He completed some group sessions but his engagement was poor. Urine drug screens during his current detention have been negative for all substances.

MENTAL HEALTH HISTORY:

Prior Diagnoses:
- Conduct Disorder (age 14, 16)
- ADHD (age 14)
- Cannabis Use Disorder (age 16)

Treatment History:
Following his father's suicide, Marcus was referred for grief counseling through South King County Children's Mental Health Services. He attended four individual sessions in June-July 2019 before refusing further treatment. Therapist notes indicate Marcus was guarded, minimally engaged, and expressed anger rather than sadness about his father's death.

At age 14, Marcus was evaluated at Harborview Medical Center Emergency Department following an assault at school. Psychiatric consultation diagnosed Conduct Disorder and ADHD. He was prescribed methylphenidate 10mg twice daily but discontinued after three weeks, reporting it made him feel "weird" and "not hungry." No follow-up psychiatric care was established.

From ages 16-17, Marcus participated in outpatient treatment at Youth Eastside Services, attending approximately every 3-4 weeks for 6 months. Treatment focused on anger management and substance abuse. His therapist noted poor engagement, frequent cancellations, and limited insight. He was discharged from services after failing to attend appointments for two months.

Psychiatric Symptoms:
Marcus denies history of hallucinations or delusions. He reports periods of depressed mood, particularly after his father's death, describing feeling "down" and having low energy. He denies history of manic symptoms. He endorses chronic difficulty with anger management, describing himself as having "a short fuse." He reports initial insomnia following his father's suicide but states sleep has normalized, though he often stays up late and sleeps irregular hours.

Marcus denied current or past suicidal ideation to this evaluator, though records indicate he endorsed passive suicidal ideation at age 14 during the Harborview evaluation ("sometimes I wish I wasn't here"). He denied any suicide attempts. He denies current homicidal ideation.

TRAUMA HISTORY:

Marcus has experienced multiple traumatic events and adverse childhood experiences:
- Exposure to domestic violence between parents (ages 5-12)
- Physical discipline from father that may have crossed into abuse
- Father's incarcerations and absences
- Witness to father's suicide at age 12 (found body)
- Victim of physical assault by peers on at least two occasions
- Exposure to community violence in neighborhood
- Investigation by Child Protective Services (experienced as traumatic)

Marcus has not received trauma-focused therapy. He tends to minimize the impact of these experiences, stating "a lot of people been through worse." However, there are indicators that unresolved trauma contributes to his current functioning, including anger, emotional numbing, difficulty with trust, and self-medication with marijuana.

CURRENT LIVING SITUATION PRIOR TO DETENTION:

Prior to his arrest on June 3, 2024, Marcus lived with his mother in a two-bedroom apartment in the Rainier Valley neighborhood of Seattle. Ms. Thompson works evening shifts, leaving Marcus unsupervised most evenings. She reports the neighborhood has significant gang activity and drug dealing, and she has been concerned about Marcus's associations with gang-affiliated peers.

The apartment is reportedly small but adequate. Marcus shared a bedroom with his mother as the second bedroom is used for storage and occasional overnight guests. Financial stress is chronic due to Ms. Thompson's modest income. They receive some public assistance including SNAP benefits.

Ms. Thompson reports that in the months before Marcus's arrest, their relationship was severely strained. They argued frequently about his behavior, associates, late hours, and suspected drug use. On several occasions she asked him to leave when he violated curfew or came home intoxicated, but he always returned and she allowed him to stay. She states, "I love my son but I can't control him anymore. I'm scared he's going to get killed out there."

PEER RELATIONSHIPS:

Marcus's peer relationships have been a significant area of concern. In childhood, he had some prosocial friendships, but these diminished over time. By early adolescence, Marcus primarily associated with older, delinquent peers, including some with known gang affiliations. His mother and probation officer both expressed concern about these associations.

Marcus describes several peers as "like brothers" to him, stating they "have his back" and look out for him. He minimizes their negative influence and becomes defensive when questioned about their involvement in criminal activity. Some of these peers have juvenile records for assault, robbery, and weapons charges.

Marcus has had limited romantic relationships. He mentioned one girlfriend at age 16 but stated it "didn't work out." He appears to derive his primary sense of belonging and identity from his male peer group.

STRENGTHS AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS:

Despite significant challenges, several protective factors are present:
- Mother who remains engaged and concerned despite strained relationship
- Extended family support (aunt, grandmother) 
- Average intelligence providing capacity for learning
- Some prosocial activities (periodic church attendance with mother)
- Some capacity for remorse and self-reflection
- Prior demonstration of ability to comply with structure (successful diversion completion)
- Athletic ability and prior interest in basketball
- Close relationship with younger cousin (age 10) whom he describes protectively

SUMMARY:

Marcus Thompson is a 17-year-old male with a history of significant adversity including exposure to domestic violence, parental substance abuse, trauma related to father's suicide, and chronic exposure to neighborhood violence. He has demonstrated escalating behavioral problems since early adolescence, meeting criteria for Conduct Disorder and Cannabis Use Disorder. Academic difficulties, peer delinquency, and inadequate prior interventions have contributed to his current situation. Despite these challenges, some protective factors are present that may support rehabilitation with appropriate intensive services.
