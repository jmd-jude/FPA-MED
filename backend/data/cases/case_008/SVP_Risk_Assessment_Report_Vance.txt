### I. Introduction and Background

Mr. Elias Vance is a 55-year-old male currently incarcerated at the Alta State Correctional Facility (ASCF) nearing the completion of his 20-year sentence for Kidnapping and Aggravated Sexual Battery (convicted 2007, index offense date 2005). This evaluation was conducted at the request of the State Attorney General's office to assess his current risk for re-offense as required for a civil commitment petition. The evaluation included a review of extensive collateral documentation (over 5,000 pages), including police reports, victim statements, pre-sentence investigation reports (PSIRs), institutional disciplinary records, treatment progress notes, and previous psychological evaluations. Three structured clinical interviews were conducted.

### II. Collateral Information Review - Criminal and Institutional History

Mr. Vance’s criminal history for sexually violent offenses is highly concerning. His adult record includes:
1.  **1991:** Assault and Battery (later adjudicated down from attempted rape); 2 years probation.
2.  **1997:** Unlawful Imprisonment and Sexual Assault; 7-year sentence, paroled 2003.
3.  **2007 (Index Offense):** Kidnapping and Aggravated Sexual Battery. The victim was a stranger abducted from a public parking lot, held for 48 hours, and subjected to multiple, non-consensual sadistic acts before her escape.

Institutional records from ASCF reveal a pervasive pattern of non-compliance and manipulation. He received 18 disciplinary infractions, including five for sexually suggestive comments directed at female staff and two for minor physical altercations. Most critically, Mr. Vance was mandated to the 'Pathways to Change' Sexual Offender Treatment Program in 2011 but was formally dismissed from the program in 2013 due to "hostile non-participation, minimization of offenses, and consistent failure to complete empathy-building assignments."

### III. Psychological and Risk Assessment Results

**A. Clinical Interview Observations:**
Mr. Vance presented as guarded, articulate, and overly formal. His affect was restricted. When discussing his index offense, he repeatedly minimized the victim's distress, referring to the assault as "a regrettable lapse in judgment" and focusing primarily on the procedural errors in his initial trial. He denied any current urges or fantasies relating to sexual violence but failed to provide a credible alternative narrative for his past behavior. He consistently denied any mental health concerns, stating, "My only disorder is being falsely accused of having a disorder."

**B. Diagnostic Formulation (DSM-5-TR):**
* **Axis I:** No major depressive or psychotic disorder. Substance Use Disorder (Alcohol) - In Sustained Remission (since 2005).
* **Axis II:** Antisocial Personality Disorder (Criteria met via PSIR and institutional records).
* **Paraphilic Disorder:** Paraphilic Disorder, Other Specified (Sexual Sadism, limited to non-consenting partners). Evidence is overwhelming from police reports and victim statements detailing the use of non-lethal asphyxia, degradation, and the infliction of pain for sexual gratification during all three confirmed sexual offense periods.

**C. Psychometric and Actuarial Risk Assessment:**
| Instrument | Score/Result | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Static-99R** | Score 8 | High-Risk Group (Estimated 57% 5-year, 74% 10-year sexual recidivism) |
| **PCL-R** | Score 35/40 | High Psychopathy (Factor 1: 18 - Interpersonal/Affective; Factor 2: 17 - Lifestyle/Antisocial) |
| **VRAG-R** | Group 9 | High Risk (Estimated 81.3% 10-year violent recidivism) |
| **SRA-20** | 18/20 Items Positive | Indicates multiple static risk factors are present across all domains (sexual history, non-sexual criminality, social adjustment). |

The scores on the Static-99R and VRAG-R place Mr. Vance in the highest statistical risk categories for both sexual and general violent re-offense. The PCL-R score of 35 is indicative of severe psychopathy, a factor strongly correlated with institutional maladjustment, poor treatment response, and high recidivism risk.

### IV. Likelihood of Future Predatory Sexual Violence

Based on the synthesis of data, the following conclusions are reached:
1.  **Mental Abnormality:** Mr. Vance suffers from a serious mental abnormality, specifically **Paraphilic Disorder, Other Specified (Sexual Sadism)**, and a **Personality Disorder (Antisocial Personality Disorder)**. The paraphilia is deemed the core mechanism driving his predatory behavior.
2.  **Likelihood of Re-offense:** The risk assessment instruments unanimously place Mr. Vance in the **High-Risk** category for future sexual recidivism. The absence of effective treatment, the severity of his underlying psychopathy (PCL-R 35), the chronic nature of his paraphilic behavior, and his lack of genuine insight or remorse are dynamic factors that, in combination with his extensive static risk (Static-99R 8), make re-offense highly likely.
3.  **Conclusion:** Mr. Vance meets the statutory criteria for commitment as a Sexually Violent Predator. His mental abnormality and personality disorder render him a menace to the health and safety of others because it is **likely** that he will engage in predatory acts of sexual violence.

**Attestation:** I attest that this evaluation was performed to a reasonable degree of medical certainty and within professional standards.
