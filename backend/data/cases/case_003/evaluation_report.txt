FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION REPORT

Case: State v. Martinez
Date of Evaluation: March 15, 2024
Evaluator: Dr. Rebecca Chen, MD
Court: Superior Court of Franklin County

REFERRAL QUESTION:
Evaluation requested to assess defendant's mental state at the time of the alleged offense for purposes of an insanity defense under the M'Naghten standard.

DEFENDANT INFORMATION:
Name: Carlos Martinez
Age: 32 years
Current Location: County Jail, Psychiatric Unit

CLINICAL INTERVIEW FINDINGS:
Mr. Martinez was cooperative during the evaluation. He presented as alert and oriented to person, place, and time. His thought process was organized and goal-directed, in marked contrast to his reported mental state during the offense period. He demonstrated good insight into his mental illness and expressed appropriate remorse for his actions.

Mr. Martinez reported a 10-year history of Bipolar I Disorder, with multiple previous manic and depressive episodes. He described his most recent manic episode, which began approximately 3 months before the alleged offense. Initially, he experienced decreased need for sleep, increased energy, and racing thoughts. However, he made the critical decision to discontinue his medications (lithium 1200mg daily and olanzapine 15mg nightly) approximately 2 months before the offense, believing he was "cured" and no longer needed treatment.

Within weeks of stopping medication, Mr. Martinez developed psychotic symptoms. He described grandiose delusions, believing he had been "chosen by God" to deliver an important message to world leaders. He reported command auditory hallucinations instructing him to enter the federal building to fulfill this divine mission. At the time of the offense, he was completely convinced of the reality of his delusions and felt compelled to follow the hallucinatory commands.

PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:
Mr. Martinez was first diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder at age 22 following a severe manic episode requiring psychiatric hospitalization. He has had approximately 4-5 mood episodes requiring hospitalization over the past decade. Between episodes, he has generally functioned well with medication compliance, maintaining steady employment and relationships. His medication regimen of lithium and olanzapine had kept him stable for nearly 3 years prior to this episode.

MENTAL STATE AT TIME OF OFFENSE:
Based on Mr. Martinez's account, collateral information from medical records, and witness statements, it is my opinion that at the time of the alleged offense, Mr. Martinez was experiencing an acute manic episode with prominent psychotic features. The grandiose delusions and command hallucinations were directly related to his untreated Bipolar I Disorder and were the driving forces behind his behavior.

DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS:
1. Bipolar I Disorder, Most Recent Episode Manic with Psychotic Features (in acute phase at time of offense; currently in partial remission with treatment)
2. Medication non-compliance (resolved - currently adherent)

OPINIONS REGARDING INSANITY DEFENSE:
It is my professional opinion that Mr. Martinez meets criteria for the insanity defense under the M'Naghten standard. At the time of the offense, due to severe mental illness with psychotic symptoms, he lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct. His actions were driven by delusional beliefs and command hallucinations that he experienced as completely real and compelling.

The fact that Mr. Martinez had been stable for years on medication and that his decompensation was directly related to medication discontinuation supports the conclusion that his criminal behavior was a direct manifestation of untreated severe mental illness rather than volitional criminal intent.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Mr. Martinez should continue current psychiatric treatment with mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medication
2. If found not guilty by reason of insanity, commitment to a secure psychiatric facility for treatment is appropriate
3. Long-term medication management and monitoring will be essential to prevent future episodes
4. Prognosis is favorable with proper treatment and medication adherence
