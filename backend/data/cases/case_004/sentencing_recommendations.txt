SENTENCING RECOMMENDATIONS

Case: State v. Thompson
Date: April 25, 2024
Evaluator: Dr. Michael Rodriguez, MD

TO THE HONORABLE COURT:

Based on the comprehensive violence risk assessment conducted on April 20, 2024, I offer the following recommendations for the court's consideration in sentencing Mr. Marcus Thompson:

STRUCTURED SENTENCING APPROACH:

Given Mr. Thompson's moderate-to-high violence risk combined with meaningful protective factors, I recommend a balanced sentencing approach that incorporates both punishment and rehabilitation:

1. INCARCERATION WITH TREATMENT:
A period of incarceration is appropriate given the seriousness of the offense and Mr. Thompson's history of recurrent violence. However, this period should emphasize treatment programming to address criminogenic needs. Recommended length: 18-24 months, with possibility of early release contingent on treatment completion and good behavior.

2. MANDATORY TREATMENT COMPONENTS:

During incarceration:
- Cognitive-behavioral therapy focused on violence reduction and anger management (minimum 20 sessions)
- Substance abuse treatment addressing alcohol and cannabis use
- Vocational training or employment skills development if needed

The completion of these treatment programs should be documented and verified before any early release consideration.

3. STRUCTURED POST-RELEASE SUPERVISION:

Extended probation period (minimum 3 years) with the following conditions:
- Regular meetings with probation officer (weekly initially, then bi-weekly)
- Mandatory substance abuse testing (random, at least twice monthly)
- Continued participation in outpatient cognitive-behavioral therapy
- Anger management group therapy
- Prohibition on alcohol and controlled substances
- Requirement to maintain stable employment or engage in approved job training
- Restriction on frequenting bars or similar establishments
- No contact with co-defendants or known criminal associates

4. LEVERAGE PROTECTIVE FACTORS:

The court should consider conditions that strengthen Mr. Thompson's protective factors:
- Requirement to maintain stable housing (court could approve residence with mother as part of release plan)
- Employment verification requirements that support his welding career
- Allowance for maintaining his prosocial relationship with girlfriend (subject to her willingness and safety assessment)

5. GRADUATED SANCTIONS AND INCENTIVES:

Implement a graduated system where:
- Technical violations result in increased supervision rather than automatic revocation
- Positive compliance (sustained employment, treatment engagement, clean drug tests) earns gradual reduction in supervision intensity
- Serious violations (new violence, persistent substance use) result in swift but proportionate consequences

RATIONALE:

This structured approach addresses Mr. Thompson's risk factors while capitalizing on protective factors. Pure punishment without treatment is likely to result in recidivism given his antisocial traits and poor coping skills. Conversely, minimal supervision would not provide the structure he needs to maintain prosocial behavior.

The combination of evidence-based treatment, extended supervision, and support for employment and family stability offers the best prospect for reducing Mr. Thompson's violence risk and protecting public safety.

MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS:

The probation department should be alerted to warning signs of increasing risk:
- Job loss or frequent job changes
- Relationship termination with current girlfriend
- Association with former criminal peers
- Substance use relapse
- Expressions of anger, resentment, or victim-blaming statements
- Housing instability

If multiple warning signs emerge, consideration should be given to intensifying supervision or implementing additional interventions before a new violent offense occurs.

ALTERNATIVE TO CONSIDER:

If the court determines that immediate incarceration is not warranted, an intensive supervised probation (ISP) program with the above treatment and supervision conditions could be considered. This would require extremely close monitoring, immediate sanctions for non-compliance, and court-ordered treatment engagement. However, given the seriousness of the instant offense and prior violence history, a period of incarceration followed by supervised release may be more appropriate to adequately address public safety concerns.
