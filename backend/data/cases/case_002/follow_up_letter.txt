Re: Carlos Rodriguez - Follow-up Evaluation

Dear Ms. Santos,

Thank you for your inquiry regarding Mr. Rodriguez's progress toward competency restoration.

I am pleased to report that Mr. Rodriguez has shown significant improvement over the past three weeks. He has been compliant with his medication regimen (Risperidone 4mg BID) and has participated actively in the competency restoration program.

Current Status:
- Auditory hallucinations have decreased in frequency and intensity
- Paranoid delusions are less prominent, though not completely resolved
- He is now able to engage in reality-based discussions about his legal case
- He correctly identified courtroom roles during our last session
- His insight into his mental illness is improving

His treatment team and I believe he is making excellent progress. However, he is not yet ready for a formal competency re-evaluation. I recommend we schedule the re-evaluation for late March, approximately 6 weeks from his initial admission.

Areas Still Requiring Work:
- Full resolution of delusional thinking
- Sustained ability to focus on legal strategy discussions
- Demonstrated understanding of plea negotiations

I will continue to monitor his progress closely. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

Dr. James Patterson, MD
